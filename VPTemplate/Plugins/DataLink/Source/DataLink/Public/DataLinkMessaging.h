	//Necessary functionalities:
	//- A way to set up a TCP connection where messages can be published to subscribers or send directly to a target. (Probably use the IMessageBus interface for this in some form.)
	//- A way to easily publish or send messages on an existing connection.
	//- Maybe functions to encode messages.
